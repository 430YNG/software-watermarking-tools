-----------

A path-based watermarking embedder/extractor demo.
gcc with 32-bit compatible and gdb with python are needed.

Use `python embed.py <source> --msg <secret>` to embed watermark and
`gdb -x extract.py <binary>` to extract it.
On extraction, the private key generated by embedder is required.
